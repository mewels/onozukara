q: what does sleepmoding  mean?

a: a few things about me and my relation to sleep and life. i think we'll start with -moding: i see life as a process, composed of events rather than objects, with everything as being at some point in a trajectory of arising -> current perception -> decay. of course arising and decay aren't definite endpoints, like how this cup used to be clay which used to be ground which used to be earth which used to be space dust. so the decay of any one of these "objects" is really the arising of another.

so because of this, it wouldn't really make sense to me to have my username be a noun - i'm not a thing, i'm an event continuously slipping through time. it would be more pertinent to describe the sorts of actions that i do rather than try to assign any sort of identitarian unity via noun-ing myself.

now, sleep. from 2012-2021-ish i was a pretty hardcore insomniac. for lots of the years of this decade i would sleep on average only 2 to 3 hours a night, with a lot of nights per week with no sleep at all. because of this, i was constantly in some sort of weird trance. simultaneously in and out of it. when i slept, i never dreamed, and when i was awake, i rarely thought.i felt like i was asleep when i was awake, and i felt like i was awake when i was asleep. you know when you lay on the floor and look at something very close up, and your eyes unfocus and refocus and maybe you see double, or look through your hand or something? i felt like that all the time. this was sleepmoding.

this is also why i don't like the name sleepmoding anymore, because i don't do so much of all that anymore. i've gotten much better at having a life and being there and things. so i should describe my processes differently! but i don't really know what i do now. i've also moved away a little from saying as many internet words so i dont know if -moding is descriptive either anymore. this is why i like onozukara.
