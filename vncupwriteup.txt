what do i think about hello girl. 

this was the 
1 - increased my capacity to do music specifically

2 - increased my capacity to work on a project, write, gave me confidence creatively

3 - made me realize i cant do it all myself

4 - brought me closer to mentha and meri

5 - gave my life a direction


hello people! hello girl has been out for a little while, and i've been dwelling on the experience of being a part of its creation. for me there were many novel experiences and discovered loves along the way. the immediately obvious one being - this was the first vn i worked on! and it was really fun! i think i've been bitten by the vn bug, especially after playing some of the other vncup entries (your wings, my wings and nothing somewhere in particular). this is a really cool medium and i'm really excited to do more with it..

not only was the first vn that i've worked on, but it was also the first thing i've ever done music for besides just my own releases. at first i was really nervous about this. i'd previously had friends want to collaborate with me on projects, and i'd never been able to come through. i always felt like i wasn't a good enough musician to handle either the workload or the creative task of bringing any unique value. previous attempts ended in either abortion or failure or dissatisfaction

but winter 2022-2023 had gone pretty well musically for me. 2021 and 2022 i almost exclusively played guitar (and now i can do my little improv fingerpicking blues thing that you'll hear pretty often in the game's soundtrack) but had composed few tracks for the instrument. i had spent the winter back in fl studio mode, and i ended up making some stuff that i'm really happy with (the yuri moment ep and the song <3 which was basically me trying to do a vocaloid 2012 keef thing). i spent a lot of time alone while living in seattle over the winter, which was very lonely, but also quite conducive to improving as a producer. 

so when merilynn asked me to help out with music for the game shortly after i moved to slc, i jumped at the chance. early on i made a lot of demos, often before we even knew what the scenes for these would be (some made it into the game, like june_dial, others did not). early on we didnt have an audio interface or even a field recorder, so i was just recording guitar into voice memos. but as meri wrote more and more, and the game became more and more real, the sound palette started to crystallize. i was usually making either solo acoustic guitar improvisations (even a few weeks out, i already have forgotten how to play much of my tracks from the game :P), or ambient-leaning electronic compositions based on a set of phone sound samples that meri and i tracked down early in the game's development. there were also a few tracks that i thought of just as "vn music". maillard's theme and the twins theme that plays in the depot scene were examples of this.

working with a creative impulse that wasn't always coming from within me was a really different experience. in a more literal sense, i did a remix of one of mentha's songs that wound its way into the game during the daydream scene. but what i really mean by this is there were so many times where meri or mentha would have an idea for how something should sound, or would say "oh, i like how this little detail sounds in the demo" or "here's how i feel when i'm writing this scene/drawing this art" and that would be the basis for the track i made. sometimes working on my own stuff can be a little paralyzing, because i don't really have a notion of how i want it to sound.. sometimes i'll have little sound design details or melodies/rhythms in my head when i do solo tracks, but ususally i just play until i get somewhere. and i love that process, but it was really cool to explore a different side of creating something more guided. 

often, mentha and meri knew a lot more than i did! for example one day when mentha was here, i was just noodling blues and mentha was like, wait.. this would work for the scene where ana first meets the twins. and i was like nahhhh idk. and i tried making some other tracks for like two weeks. the track for that scene was hanging over my head for a while though, with the deadline getting closer and closer, and so one day i just picked up the guitar and recorded a little improvised blues melody kinda like what i had been playing that day, and there it was.

another track i really struggled with making was the track that plays during the phone calls at the beginning-middle of the game; the first take i had made was too ominous, and i couldnt find the balance between making something neutral and sparce enough to not be obtrusive (and usable in scenes of different moods) while still making it interesting. mentha helped me a lot by remarking offhand that she really liked a synth i had made for my remix of resonance. i ahd made the synth from processing a sxs phone dial beep, and so i remade it, and the track was done within 30 mins. there were so many occurences like that! really opened my eyes to how cool working with people can be. and the tracks that soapdrip and kali made were really cool too, it was fun to hear how they represented certain scenes, and how trying out different tracks in certain places could give the same writing a totally different perspective. this also really helped me expand my view of what was "on the table", so to speak.

in all there's 24 songs in the game, i made 16 of them, and i'm really really happy with all of them. i can't think of the last time i made 16 tracks that i liked within a 3 month period, and i think i progressed as an artist while making this game in a way that i never would have just making albums or singles or what have you. 

this game also allowed me to expand a lot as an artist beyond music too - i got to write a bit of the script. creative writing has never been my strong suit - i typically prefer to write non-fiction, or just rambling conversationalism like what you have here. i've always struggled taking ideas in my head and putting them into concrete words; though i think of settings, characters, dynamics, themes a lot, i can never really translate them into concrete lines, or a script. reading meri and mentha's writing, and talking with them so much about the game every day, i gradually became more and more accustomed to living in ana + courier's world, and so i gradually found a voice that i could use from time to time. i'm still not a writer, but i really enjoyed having the opportunity to broaden my skillset a bit.

in particular, i think my biggest fingerprint on the game besides the music and sound was just being in the room to consult and build ideas with. this was the essense of the project to me. having meri and mentha and i in the same room for like.. 16 hours a day was such a good environment to hash things out in, and i really don't think the game would have been made in the same way if we all three hadn't been together. so many casual convos or offhand ideas ended up worming their way into the game. the environment was such that the words you said almost felt real as you spoke them. like the game was living through our conversations, and all that was left to do was  transcribe it. we gradually i think shared the story in our heads - not necessarily the script, but the spirit. this is the core of what hello girl means to me - it's a spirit that we all gave birth to collectively, in the process becoming closer together.

i got a lot closer with meri over the course of the game. we went from friends to girlfriends, and i became really good friends with mentha too! we went from "some people" to being the imo team! i'm really really excited to work with them more .. cus there will be more .... 

this game gave me a direction to live in for a while, and i'm forever grateful for that. i've long struggled with feeling like a lazy and inept person, and longed for the chance to pour myself into something, to get so excited about a project that it consumed every moment of my time. especially for the 10 days when mentha was here, it was nearly exactly that. i loved every second of it, and i want to make my life about doing things like this as much as i can. i want my life to be about making things with the people i love, and i will forever owe a debt to this game and the imo team for helping me realize that. this game gave me the confidence that given the right project, i can be a non-lazy, capable, and even valuable person.
