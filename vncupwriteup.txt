what do i think about hello girl. 

this was the 
1 - increased my capacity to do music specifically

2 - increased my capacity to work on a project, write, gave me confidence creatively

3 - made me realize i cant do it all myself

4 - brought me closer to mentha and meri

5 - gave my life a direction


hello people! hello girl is out.. has been out for a little while, and i've been dwelling on the experience of being a part of its creation. there were a lot of firsts, a lot of novel experiences, and a lot of discovered loves involved in its creation. for one, this was the first vn i worked on! and it was really fun - i think i've been bitten by the vn bug, especially after playing some of the other vncup entries (your wings, my wings and nothing somewhere in particular). this is a really cool medium and i'm really excited to do more with it..

i said this was the first vn that i've worked on, but it was also the first thing i've ever done music for besides just my own small scale releases. and at first i was really nervous about this. i'd previously had friends try to collaborate, jam, etc with me on things, and i'd never felt quite up to it. i always felt like i wasn't a good enough musician to handle either the workload or the task of bringing any unique creativity to a project. and partially this was true, back in 2018 - 2019, the last times i really attempted to work with someone else, i don't think i was one tenth of the musician i am today. not that its like a metric or whatever but. yeah. previous attempts ended in either abortion or failure or dissatisfaction

but winter 2022-2023 had gone pretty well musically for me. 2021 and 2022 i almost exclusively played guitar, and now i can do my little dinky fingerpicking blues thing that you'll hear pretty often in the game's soundtrack, but i had spent the winter back in fl studio mode, and i made some stuff that i'm actually still really happy with - the yuri moment ep and the song <3 which was basically me trying to do a vocaloid 2012 keef thing. 

so my confidence in both my guitar and production was pretty good, and so when merilynn asked me to help out with music for the game shortly after i moved to slc, i was really excited to work on it. i made a lot of demos, often before we even knew what the scenes for these would be (some made it into the game, like june_dial, others did not). early on we didnt have an audio interface or even a field recorder, so i was just recording guitar into voice memos. but as meri wrote more and more, the sound palette started to flesh itself out more, and the tracks i made were usually either solo acoustic guitar, or ambient-leaning electronic compositions based on a set of phone sound samples that meri and i tracked down early in the game's development. 

working with a creative impulse that wasn't always coming from within me was a really different experience. in a more literal sense, i did a remix of one of mentha's songs that wound its way into the game during the daydream scene. but what i really mean by this is there were so many times where meri or mentha would have an idea for how something should sound, or would say "oh, i like how this little detail sounds in the demo" or "here's how i feel when i'm writing this scene/drawing this art" and that would be the basis for the track i made. sometimes working on my own stuff can be a little paralyzing, because i don't really have a notion of how i want it to sound.. sometimes i'll have little sound design details or melodies/rhythms in my head when i do solo tracks, but ususally i just play until i get somewhere. and i love that process, but it was really cool to explore a different side of creating something more guided. 

often, mentha and meri knew a lot more than i did! for example one day when mentha was here, i was just noodling blues and mentha was like, wait.. this would work for the scene where ana first meets the twins. and i was like nahhhh idk. and i tried making some other tracks for like two weeks. the track for that scene was hanging over my head for a while though, with the deadline getting closer and closer, and so one day i just picked up the guitar and recorded a little improvised blues melody kinda like what i had been playing that day, and there it was. there were so many occurences like that! really opened my eyes to how cool working with people can be. and the tracks that soapdrip and kali made were really cool too, it was fun to hear how they represented certain scenes, and how trying out different tracks in certain places could give the same writing a totally different perspective. this also really helped me expand my view of what was "on the table", so to speak.

n all there's 24 songs in the game, i made 16 of them, and i'm really really happy with all of them. i can't think of the last time i made 16 tracks that i liked within a 3 month period...
